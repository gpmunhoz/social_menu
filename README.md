I made a simple share menu using only css an html to make it as light as possible.
You need to click on the share button to activate the others ( Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Email, Linkedin, Pinterest and VK) [you can easly add or remove itens to it].
I thought this menu to be used such on desktop and on mobile.
Just need to add a code to grab the url of the page it's on and it should be ready to be used.
